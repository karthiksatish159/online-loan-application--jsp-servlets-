IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN APPLYING FOR A HOME LOAN:
============================================================
Principal:
----------
This is the amount of money you will be borrowing from the bank or financial institution.
Duration:
--------
How long you will be paying back the loan. Depending on the nature of your expected income, you can select a period that suits you.
Interest:
---------
The bank or financial institution charges interest in exchange for its money lending services. The rate of interest is dependent on the amount of the principal and the duration for which you will be repaying the loan.
EMI Amount:
----------
You will be paying monthly instalments for the duration of your borrowing, until the end of the loan period. Each EMI is a combination of principal + interest. With each EMI, you will be paying back more of the principal and costs of interest will gradually reduce.
