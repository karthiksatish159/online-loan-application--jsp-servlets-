<p><h3><strong>Eligibility Criteria for Home Loan</strong></h3>
&nbsp;

<p>Eligibility criteria for the Bajaj Finserv Home Loan are simple and any Indian national with a good financial profile can obtain funding. The criteria differ depending on whether you are salaried or self-employed. The criteria are also inter-dependant. For instance, for two persons of the same age, the one with a higher credit score is likely to be able to borrow a higher loan amount.</p>
